# EDA and Hypothesis Testing - Insurance Claim Data
This project delves into an insurance claim dataset, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and claim patterns.

The data contains customer demographics and who all issued an insurance claim. This project analyzes insurance claim data to understand customer behavior and claim patterns. It involves:
- data integration, cleansing
- analysis tasks such as age categorization, flag creation for unreported claims
- calculating average claim amounts by segments.
- Insights gained help in improving insurance services and strategies.

Here python was employed to test hypotheses regarding insurance claim patterns and customer behavior. Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn, clear and insightful graphs were generated to visualize findings and enhancing understanding.
